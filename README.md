A repository of information which is already public, in easier and more usable formats.

"Conductor Tables.xlsx" has a few line conductor tables in one place, as a one-stop shop for publicly available line wire data:
- Conductor Tables - "Electric Power Distribution Engineering" (Turan Gonen) Second Edition. Appendix A. (Digitized using FineReader - hand scrubbed by yours truly)
- The RateKit SI & US wire data which came in the free version (http://www.usi-power.com/ratekit-thermal-rating-toolkit/) (Contact USi-Power)
- The "SWRate-v4.2 CondData.mdb" file which comes in the free version of SouthWire Rate (Contact SouthWire)

The Conductor Tables from Turan Gonen's book have been converted into a format required by PowerFactory as well, to more easily use it.
That data is mostly from the Westinghouse Transmission and Distribution text-book, which is no longer in print (But very frequently referenced in the utility industry).
